    <strong><u>Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury</u></strong>
    .
    <em>
        Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for
        MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
    </em>
    <strong><u> </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(a) </strong>
    <em>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</em>
    All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any
    product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
    individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries,
    affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
    services or goods provided under the Terms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(b) </strong>
    <em>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</em>
    . Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing
    the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 500 YALE AVE N, SUITE 100, SEATTLE, WA
    98109. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the
    claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
    any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is
    entitled.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(c) </strong>
    <em>Arbitration Rules. </em>
    Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), an established alternative dispute resolution
    provider (“<strong>ADR Provider</strong>”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall
    agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the
    method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules
    governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single,
    neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00 ) may be
    resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
    award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be
    held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment
    on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s
    fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(d) </strong>
    <em>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration</em>
    : If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the
    specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
    witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(e) </strong>
    <em>Time Limits</em>
    . If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal
    deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(f) </strong>
    <em>Authority of Arbitrator</em>
    . If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be
    consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all
    or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
    individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
    essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to
    award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(g) </strong>
    <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>
    . THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that
    all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
    efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise
    between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL
    RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(h) </strong>
    <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>
    . ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS,
    AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(i) </strong>
    <em>Confidentiality</em>
    . All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly
    confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a
    court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(j) </strong>
    <em>Severability. </em>
    If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such
    specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(k) </strong>
    <em>Right to Waive</em>
    . Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not
    waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(l) </strong>
    <em>Survival of Agreement. </em>
    This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(m) </strong>
    <em>Small Claims Court</em>
    . Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(n) </strong>
    <em>Emergency Equitable Relief.</em>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending
    arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(o) </strong>
    <em>Claims Not Subject To Arbitration</em>
    . Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other
    party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(p) </strong>
    <em>Courts</em>
    . In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal
    jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco, California, for such purpose.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13.8 </strong>
    <strong><u>Governing Law</u></strong>
    . The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal
    Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention
    on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13.9 </strong>
    <strong><u>Notice</u></strong>
    . Where the Company requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing the Company with your most current e-mail address. In
    the event that the last e-mail address you provided to the Company is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices
    required/ permitted by the Terms, the Company’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give
    notice to the Company at the following address: 500 YALE AVE N, SUITE 100, SEATTLE, WA 98109. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by the
    Company by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13.10 </strong>
    <strong><u>Waiver</u></strong>
    . Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on
    any other occasion.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13.11 </strong>
    <strong><u>Severability</u></strong>
    . If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the
    invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13.12 </strong>
    <strong><u>Export Control</u></strong>
    . You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Company Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained
    the Company Properties, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but without limitation, the Company Properties may not be exported or re-exported (a)
    into any United States embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S.
    Department of Commerce’s Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Company Properties, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a
    country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country and (ii) you
    are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use the Company Properties for any purpose prohibited by
    U.S. law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. You acknowledge and agree that
    products, services or technology provided by Company are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States. You shall comply with
    these laws and regulations and shall not, without prior U.S. government authorization, export, re-export, or transfer the Company products, services or
    technology, either directly or indirectly, to any country in violation of such laws and regulations.
